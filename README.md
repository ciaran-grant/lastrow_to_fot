# lastrow_to_fot
First repository ever created - bare with me.

This repo is for functions to convert @LastRow tracking data into Friends of Tracking friendly format. 
Functions all in lastrow_to_friendsoftracking.py with Jupyter Notebook example aswell.

Any questions let me know and will do my best to help.
